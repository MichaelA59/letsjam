Hi, my name is Mike, I'm 29 years old and I can confidently say that, in  web
development - I have finally found my dream job.

I began my journey as a self-taught musician. Now, when I started, at the age of 16,
I had no idea what I was doing and looking back, I feel really bad for subjecting
my parents to late night jams that were just barely listenable. But I had a passion
for playing and that allowed me excel.

A year ago, I decided to find a challenging new adventure that would utilize my
creative skills. Thats when I learned about coding. With code, I'm able to take an
idea and make it a reality, much like music. So, for my capstone project, I decided
to tackle a problem I faced when working freelance as a music instructor. I always
wanted there to be a central location for teachers and students to find each other.

So I created Let's Jam. My app makes it easy for teachers to find students and vice verse.
Upon signing up for an account, a user can specify a Teacher or Student designation.

Users can see a full list of either Students or Teachers from the homepage by clicking
on one of two buttons. They can see quick bullet point details about the various users
and clicking on the Username will redirect to that user's profile page.




Learning an instrument is a long-term commitment and you wouldn't want to learn from
someone unless they were well vetted. To solve this, I have allowed students
the ability to rate Teachers on a variety of metrics, including things like clarity
of instruction and competence.

The backend of my app was created using Rails. On the front end
I chose to use React and I did so for a few reasons. First, it was the one area I
struggled with most during my time at Launch and secondly. React allowed me to to
make transitions to different content something that felt natural rather than forced.

This project was a labor of love that solved a problem I encountered before knowing
anything about coding. I look forward to joining a team that encourages learning
and experimentation above all else. I have growing interest in all things front-end
and design and hope to further develop this skill

Again, my name is Mike and I would like to thank you for you time this morning.

Hello, my name is Mike Adamski. I'm really excited to speak with you today. Along
with being a newly minted web developer, I have also been a self-taught musician
for the last 10 years. In that time I have also been an instructor to as many as
12 students, teaching multiple instruments.

Unfortunately, music doesn't pay as well as I would have liked, so for the past
few years I have been searching out a career path that fulfills my curiosity
for artistic creation and my penchant for logical problem solving. That's
when I found Launch Academy.

Using the skills I have learned over the last 10 weeks here at Launch, I have been
able to create an app that solves a problem I have faced in the past - namely, finding
students to teach.

My application is called Let's Jam and it links up students in search of music
instructors with Teachers both locally and remote. My approach to building this
app has foremost been focused on user experience and tailoring the flow of the
app to be more inline with the needs of a creative community.

To that end, the majority of the front-end was completed using React. I chose React
because of its popularity, capabilities and smooth user experience.

The backend was completed using Rails and ActiveRecord
