Hello, my name is Mike Adamski. I'm really excited to speak with you today. Along
with being a budding programmer I have also been a self-taught musician
for the last 10 years. In that time I have also been an instructor to as many as
12 students, teaching multiple instruments.

> !!! Don't focus on money !!!

Unfortunately, music doesn't pay as well as I would have liked, so for the past
few years I have been searching out a career path that fulfills my curiosity
for artistic creation and my penchant for logical problem solving. That's
when I found Launch Academy.

Using the skills I have learned over the last 10 weeks here at Launch, I have been
able to create an app that solves a problem I have faced in the past - namely, finding
students to teach.

My application is called Let's Jam and it links up students in search of music
instructors with Teachers both locally and remote. My approach to building this
app has foremost been focused on user experience and tailoring the flow of the
app to be more inline with the needs of a creative community.

To that end, the majority of the front-end was completed using React. I chose React
because of its popularity, capabilities and smooth user experience.

The backend was completed using Rails and ActiveRecord
