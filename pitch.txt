Hi, my name is Mike . I am 29 years old, I'm from Western Mass and I can
confidently say that, in programming - I have finally found my dream job.

Apart from being a developer I'm also a self-taught musician. This has exposed me
to a world of creation and collaboration. I've seen first hand how passion alone
can yield tremendous growth.

The same passion that propelled my growth in music is now being utilized here at Launch.
Being a developer affords me the ability to use creative ways to solve problems.
It also relies heavily on collaboration and communication between team-members.

With code, I'm able to take an idea and make it a reality. So, for my capstone project,
I decided to tackle a problem I faced when working freelance as a music instructor.

I had the skills to teach and word of mouth certainly helped with my business but
I always felt like there should be an easier way for students to connect with teachers.
So I created Let's Jam.

My app is a meeting place for teachers and students alike to connect. Upon signing
up for an account, a user can specify a Teacher or Student designation. They can also
sign up for an account using LinkedIn, Google or Facebook.

Users are able to search for one another using the Google API. Additionally, Students
are able to search for instructors offering online-learning. When a Student and Teacher
connect for an online learning experience, a Zoom video chat link will be automatically
generated and sent to both the Student and Teacher via Email.

Learning an instrument is a long-term commitment and you wouldn't want to learn from
someone unless they were well vetted. To solve this, I have allowed students
the ability to rate Teachers on a variety of metrics, including things like clarity
of instruction and competence.

Drawing inspiration from places like Angie's List, Instructors with music degrees
will receive a star that will be prominently displayed on both their profile and
the index page. This is verified using the LinkedIn API.

The backend of my app was created using Rails. On the front end
I chose to use React and I did so for a few reasons. First, it was the one area I
struggled with most during my time at Launch and secondly. React allowed me to to
make transitions to different content something that felt natural rather than forced.

This project was a labor of love that solved a problem I encountered before knowing
anything about coding. I look forward to joining a team that encourages learning
and experimentation above all else. I have growing interest in all things front-end
and design and hope to further develop this skill

Again, my name is Mike and I would like to thank you for you time this morning.

Hello, my name is Mike Adamski. I'm really excited to speak with you today. Along
with being a newly minted web developer, I have also been a self-taught musician
for the last 10 years. In that time I have also been an instructor to as many as
12 students, teaching multiple instruments.

Unfortunately, music doesn't pay as well as I would have liked, so for the past
few years I have been searching out a career path that fulfills my curiosity
for artistic creation and my penchant for logical problem solving. That's
when I found Launch Academy.

Using the skills I have learned over the last 10 weeks here at Launch, I have been
able to create an app that solves a problem I have faced in the past - namely, finding
students to teach.

My application is called Let's Jam and it links up students in search of music
instructors with Teachers both locally and remote. My approach to building this
app has foremost been focused on user experience and tailoring the flow of the
app to be more inline with the needs of a creative community.

To that end, the majority of the front-end was completed using React. I chose React
because of its popularity, capabilities and smooth user experience.

The backend was completed using Rails and ActiveRecord
